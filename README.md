N1550 Data Analytics for Accounting  Finance 
Assessment Instrument Group Project (assessment type PRJ) 
Your Assessment at a glance. 
Note for A3 resit students: In the A1 exam period, this PRJ had to be submitted as a group of two. In the A3 resit period, you should submit this assessment individually. You will not incur a penalty for solo submissions, and you do not need to raise the issue with the module convenor before you submit. 
If you have previously submitted this assessment in A1 or before, then you should choose a different dataset from the one you have chosen before. In contrast to the A1 exam period, you do not need to ask prior permission from the module convenor to choose a dataset. 
The aim of this assessment is to analyse a dataset of your choice using the techniques covered in the module.
Number of words 
2,000 +/- 10% as per Sussex policy. 
Word count includes tables and charts that are part of the 
main body (i.e, not part of any optional appendices) 
Word count excludes optional references and appendices. 
Please supply tables and charts inline (not at the end). Screenshot all Python code. 
References are optional in this assignment (apart from a 
reference to the dataset), if you include them please use 
Harvard referencing style. 
Percentage of total mark 
40% 
Deadline 
Please check Sussex Direct for the definite date and time. 
Choice of dataset 
You can choose a dataset of your choice, which must meet the following criteria:1. It must be a public domain, freely available dataset.2. The dataset should ideally contain at least two tables connected by primary keys and foreign keys. If the dataset contains just one table, it should be clear that it has been denormalised.3. The dataset must contain a metric variable which can realistically serve as adependent variable (for example, a performance score of some kind)4. The dataset must contain another metric variable which can realistically serve as anindependent variable.5. The dataset must contain at least one categorical variable (to assist with analysis). You could create a categorical variable from a metric variable using Python.
A good place to look for suitable datasets is Kaggle (https//www.kaggle.com) but this is not required. The textbook has a list of suitable sites in Chapter 2, Exhibit 2-1, p. 55.
Any report with a dataset that does not meet the above criteria will normally be capped at 40%.
Marking criteria 
We will assess your report on the basis of the standard criteria for projects at the Year 2 Undergraduate Level, which you can find on Canvas. 
More specific marking guidance for this project is provided in the section “Structure of the Report” below. Structure of report Use the following structure to write your report:IMPACT Step Mark weighting

2. Mastering the Data 25% 
Produce a database 
model for the 
dataset, either ERD 
or UML. 
Identify primary and foreign keys. 
(The model may contain only one table, but you can and should still identify how the table was constructed from normalised tables) 
Use Excel VLOOKUP or DB Browser for SQLite to access and join the data into a denormalised table. 
Produce a database 
model for the 
dataset, either ERD 
or UML. 
There are multiple 
tables for the 
dataset, and one-to-many 
relationships are clearly identified. 
Identify primary and foreign keys. 
Use DB Browser for SQLite or Python to import the data. Join 
the datasets with 
Pandas and export the final dataset to Excel. 
3. Performing test plan 25% Perform. a regression 
analysis using Excel 
Document the outcome. The regression result may relate to your questions. 
Perform. a regression 
analysis using Excel or Python. 
Use Python to import 
the dataset and 
highlight some 
unusual values. 
Document the outcome. 
The regression result should relate to your questions. 
4. Address and Refine Results 25% 
Answer the three 
questions 
about your dataset, 
and use three 
appropriate 
visualisations to 
illustrate your answers. 
Provide a clear and concise narrative. 
Answer the three questions 
about your dataset, 
and use three 
appropriate 
visualisations to 
illustrate your answers. 
Include traditional  non-traditional 
charts to illustrate 
your points (something else other than 
pie charts, bar charts, or line charts). 5. Communicate Insights 10% Wrap up your report. Write in plain English what you have found. Wrap up your report. 
6. Optional References 
7. Optional Appendices 
For a definition of some of the terms, please refer to the module lectures, seminars, and textbook. Document all Python code that is used. A statement such as ‘we used Python’ is not sufficient. Liberally use screenshots to document your points.All screenshots should be full-screen screenshots. We do not accept partial or strategically cropped screenshots.Learning Outcomes being Assessed The following two course learning outcomes are being assessed with this instrument:· LO2 Work effectively independently and collaboratively· LO4 Communicate information, ideas, problems, and solutions to specialist and nonspecialist audiences using a variety of technologies
The following two module learning outcomes are being assessed with this instrument:· LO2 Develop and correctly interpret core data management concepts that are fundamental to the design of modern information systems in accounting and finance· LO3 Extract, visualise, and communicate key trends and insights from large datasets in the context of accounting and finance
